where the lower levels are the closest to the hardware and the higher you go the
closer you get to the user. Each level adds some abstraction to the one below it
by hiding any implementation detail that is not useful to that particular level.
This way, we can write code at a higher level while freeing our limited mental
capacity by letting go of the need to know every implementation detail.
</p>

<p>Thinking about abstraction also helps when working between teams as it helps
with delegating responsibilities between teams.
</p>

<p>For example, consider a scenario in which Team A is working on building a data
pipeline for a machine learning project. Team B needs to access specific data in
particular points as it&apos;s passing through the data pipeline (e.g. for
statistical analysis reasons). In this case we would have two possibilities:
</p>

<ol><li><p>Team A writes specific code every time Team B asks for something specific
</p>
</li>
<li><p>Team A writes an abstraction over their existing code, e.g. a public function
or library which Team B can directly use to write their specific tasks as
needed.
</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>By writing an abstraction over their existing code (read: layer in the software
pyramid), Team A made it possible for Team B to access what they need without
caring to learn how the underlying software layer is implemented. In other
words, Team A implemented an abstraction barrier which is a layer of functions
that hide the implementation so well that you can completely forget about how it
is implemented even when using those functions. It should be noted that the &quot;not
caring&quot; is symmetrical and works both ways. Team B does not care about how the
data pipeline is implemented, but Team A also does not care about how Team B
implement their solutions using the abstraction barrier.

<div><h2 id="one-ce3f141e08">When to use abstraction barriers:</h2><div><h3 id="one-451bea95d6">1. To facilitate changes of implementation</h3><div><p>In cases of high uncertainty about how you want to implement something, an abstraction barrier can be the layer of indirection that lets you change the implementation later. This property might be useful if you are prototyping something and you still don&apos;t know how best to implement it. Or perhaps you <u>know</u> something will change; you&apos;re just not ready to do it yet, like if you know you will want to get data from the server eventually, but for now you&apos;ll just stub it out.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div><h3 id="one-c52b099493">2. To make code easier to write and read</h3><div><p>Abstraction barriers allow us to ignore details. Sometimes those details are bug magnets. Did we initialize the loop variables correctly? Did we have an off-by-one error in the loop exit condition? An abstraction barrier that lets you ignore those details will make your code easier to write. If you hide the right details, then less adept programmers can be productive when using it.

<div><h3 id="one-170df09fb2">3. To reduce coordination between teams</h3><div><p>Our development team could change things without talking with marketing first. And marketing could write simple marketing campaigns without checking in with development. The abstraction barrier allows teams on either side to ignore the details the other team handles. Thus, each team moves faster.

<div><h3 id="one-456dabf1a0">4. To mentally focus on the problem at hand</h3><div><p>They let you think more easily about the problem you are trying to solve. An abstraction barrier makes some details unimportant to the problem we are solving right now. It means we are less likely to make a mistake and less likely to get tired.
