libraries. Or rather, well-documented libraries and I am not talking about
docstrings here. Most library authors will write some comments and let the
document generator and type system do the work for them. It&apos;s not how it works
and Haskell will never take off until this issue has been tackled. Most people
will have a hard time figuring out how to make a real-world project, while
people who are not beginners will keep hitting brick wall after brick wall until
they either reach some sort of God-like understanding of Haskell or give up
entirely and rewrite the project in another language.
</p>

<p>This is not entirely on the library authors either. For some reason the entire
Haskell community is adverse to writing good documentation and/or tutorials.
Everyone seems to be enamored with the idea that the terminology used should be
as cryptic and unaccessible as possible and that everyone should be able to
completely grasp the type system and all the various intricacies that one finds
in a language like Haskell since day one. Now before someone starts thinking
about the reasons why this is, I&apos;d like to mention that I know very well about
Haskell&apos;s start in academia and how deeply rooted in maths it is, but
unfortunately most software engineers and most importantly project managers do
not care about function purity or how you can rewrite crucial parts of an
infrastructure by using co-monoids and functors. What matters are results, ease
of development, and a strong knowledge base that unfortunately is lacking.
