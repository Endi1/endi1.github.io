learn and understand subjects deeply. It aligns well with the practice of
writing about what you learn, and its principles can be summarized as follows:
</p>

<ul><li><p>Choose a concept: Select a concept or topic you want to understand
</p>
</li>
<li><p>Teach it to a child: Try to explain the concept as if you were teaching it to
a child. Use simple language and avoid jargon.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>Identify gaps and go back to the source material: If you find areas where your
explanation falters, go back to the source material to fill in the gaps.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>Simplify and use analogies: Create analogies and use simple language to make
the concept more relatable and easier to grasp.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>Review and refine: Continuously review and refine your explanation until you
can articulate the concept in the simplest terms possible.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
