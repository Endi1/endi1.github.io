<a href="https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode">lsp-mode</a> for years. The main reason for switching was the fact that
eglot is now built-in into emacs and as such it&apos;s independent from the
whims of maintainers and contributors for its survival. Even though I
must say that I have nothing but the greatest admiration for the
maintainers and contributors of lsp-mode, since, as I said, I&apos;ve been
happily using it for years.
</p>

<p>So far my experience with Eglot has been <i>just fine</i>. It does its thing
and stays out of my way most of the time, which is what you&apos;d want
from an lsp client. It can be too minimalistic at times, and it lacks
some of the features that I enjoyed in lsp-mode, such as built-in
support for installing missing servers, or multi-server
support. Especially the latter is sorely missed because for Python
development I was used to running pyright and ruff (as an lsp server)
at the same time. But fortunately I can still get ruff support through
<a href="https://github.com/erickgnavar/flymake-ruff/tree/1074f358736ace68d0eefa9cd7727ebed0de7c00">flymake-ruff</a>.
</p>

<p>I&apos;ll keep using it for some more weeks and then decide if it&apos;s worth
putting my fate in the hands of lsp-mode again or not. One thing I&apos;m
sure of, is that I&apos;m happy that I finally gave eglot a shot, and if
nothing else, I know that there&apos;s always going to be a pretty good lsp
client for emacs out there.
